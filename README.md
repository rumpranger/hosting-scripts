Simple tools for hosting

Disclaimer: Most of these tools are readily available via munin, nagios and a plethora of other software libraries. 
Due to the nature of our current hosting across several dozen providers each with different os', access levels and 
support systems we came up with this simple set of checks all dependent upon nothing but a webserver and or php to
determine the current server status and facilitate getting support in a timely manner.
